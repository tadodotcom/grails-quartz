 * This class can purge all of the quartz tables on startup if you set the config flag quartz.purgeQuartzTablesOnStartup = true
 * Mostly used for testing or development purposes. It is not recommended you use this for production as you can
 * miss missfire recoveries, persisted jobs/triggers, etc.
